Embedded systems engineer focused on bare-metal C and hardware-aware firmware design.

Microcontrollers: AVR (AVR-1 series), STM32 (ARM Cortex-M)

Work at the peripheral and register level

Sensors, ADCs, timers, PWM, UART, GPIO

Emphasis on timing, signal integrity, and predictable behavior

GitHub is used as a personal workspace for drivers, experiments, and reusable embedded modules.

Hardware is honest. Firmware has to be precise.
